# HKIoTDemo

Summary
-------
This git repository contains the source code of all of the different scenarios used to create the Harman IoT demo. 

The three main scenario are listed below:

1) Wake Up 

- The user sets a time they would like to wake by, and can a configure a customized alarm with the options to play a song, receive a weather forecast, and/or turn on the lights when they wake up. 

2) Shower 

- The user configures a time they would like to shower at most to, and whether they want periodic alerts playing to remind them of the current duration. At maximum preferred time, the speakers will alert the user that they have showered at their preferred maximum time. 

3) Leave/Going out

- The user tells a voice sensor "I'm leaving now" and the Harman IoT server will check if all SmartThing sensors are intact, notifying the user if any are open, as well as give a weather forecast update before you go out. 

Extra Extra!
------------
"Follow Me Audio" is also included in this repo. Follow Me Audio is proximity based audio playback using the Harman SDK with iBeacons. Going from room to room in a connected home, music/ebooks/etc will continue playing!
