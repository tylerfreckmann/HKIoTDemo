About the project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Using Harman SDK, we were able to connect their speakers with other APIs and platforms. We were able to see how wifi enabled speakers can have an impact in a connected lifestyle environment. 

Challenges we ran into
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Brainstorming and figuring the different possible APIs we could use in this demo was tough. The amount of public APIs out there is outstanding, and filtering out the choices for the purpose of our demos was fun task. Other challenges we ran into include figuring out what the best platform as a service would be. We had to also consider how to acheive the best user experience as well.
